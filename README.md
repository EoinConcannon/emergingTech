## Module Overview


## Tasks
### Task One
In task one, I was tasked with getting five books from Gutenberg.org. These books serve as the groundwork for our language model. This is probably the most important/interesting requirement of the tasks as depending on what you chose can have an influence on the type of words that are generated. For example, I chose Friedrich Nietzsche's book "Beyond Good and Evil" (published in 1886) and Miguel de Cervantes's book "Don Quixote" (published in 1605), my choosing of these books will show influences of German and Spanish.

### Task Two

### Task Three

### Task Four


## Project
The project for this module is to create an ELIZA chatbot and to deploy it using Github Actions.
This project will be made using HTML, CSS for a user interface. JavaScript and/or WebAssembly for the chatbot logic.

I chose to use JavaScript over WebAssembly as JavaScript is usually the 2nd best for chatbot creation behind Python.

I made ELIZA's response immediate as it is similar to how the original ELIZA works.
